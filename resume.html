                <p class="mb-2">
                  I have worked with small and large language models to extract information from scientific text and (almost, soon) got a PhD from it. 
                  I also advised my wet lab colleagues on data analysis, data management and data visualization.

                <p class="mb-2">
                  I have analysed genomics and transcriptomics data to figure out if they could explain why a cancer drug works in some people but not in others. I also looked at what kind of mutations are in metastatic cancer patients and whether that chnages when the metastases are in the liver, the bones or other places (you can read the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11927350/" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-indigo-300 font-medium hover:font-semibold transition">article</a> if you are interested).

                <p class="mb-2">
                  My first foray into Natural Language Processing, as thesis subject for my Bioinformatics MSc. I built biomedical Named Entity Recognition models with spaCy and Keras.

                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  I trained a panel to rate how strong fragrances smell, tried to see why they smell strong, and smelled dirty laundry (turns out there are companies that can sell you some, categorized by how dirty it is). And looked at the data behind all of it, of course.

                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  I guided our beverage and savoury scientists to develop the best flavors they could for our clients. Think discriminative perception tests, flavor profiling and consumer surveys. Had fun doing statistics on it all.

                <p class="mb-2">
                  I trained a panel to taste liquor three times a week. Checked the data and tried to make them better. Worked both on flavour and mouthfeel.

                <p class="mb-2">
                  I used eye tracking software to see how people are reacting to a champagne add. Also did a bit of analysis to see how they look at images and what influences their choice. And organized a whisky consumer test in home conditions and did a bit of panel leading.

                  Took a gap year abroad. Spent 6 months promoting French wines in China and 6 months doing new product development in a chocolate factory in the middle of the Peruvian jungle. Confirmed that my Spanish is a lot better than my Chinese. Came back with new recipes (I can make really good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaolongbao" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-800 dark:hover:text-indigo-300 font-medium hover:font-semibold transition">xiao long bao</a>).
